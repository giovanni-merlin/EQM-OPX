Repository for the OPX+ control at EQM Lab (Prof. S. Whitlock, University of Strasbourg).

It contains scripts used to control the OPX+ hardware and implement some experimental sequences.
To get started, see "OPX_demo.ipynb" for an introduction on how to play your first simple pulses and some references to Quantum Machines' official documentation. Refer to that for detailed usage.
The MLOOP folder contains scripts for parameters optimization, to be used with the MLOOP package.
